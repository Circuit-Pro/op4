**Longitudinal Info**
----------------------

This fork has full long control for all HKG with radar harness and Harnessless for older 2015 & 2016 & 2017 Genesis G80(Fixed SMDPS) without any radar harness mod. All other cars should require scc to be moved to bus 2 from bus 0 for full long control.

**Reach out to johnpr#5623 on discord to buy a radar harness. MDPS harnesses are available for sale with a 1 1/2 week lead time. Software to control it is currently WORKING and SUPPORTED!!**


***Open Street Maps!***
---------------------
   - Speed limit wrong or missing? Contribute to Open Street Maps in your area! https://www.openstreetmap.org
   - Special Thanks to the Move-Fast Team for all the help and hard work with OSM!
   - With an active internet connection, and HKG Long, OpenPilot can plan ahead using vision and map data to slow for curves and adjust the longitudinal plan for speed limit and other factors.
   - Cruise speed does not adjust SCC max set speed, it instead adjusts longitudinal plan. So for it to work set max SCC speed higher than speed limit. To override speed limit tap on speed limit symbol on screen in top left corner next to max speed.
   - All Settings are under `Toggles` in `Settings`.
   - We have the correct DBC for newer Hyundais(2019+ and have built in navigation) to pull speed limit information from head unit over can bus, There is a toggle to do this `Pull Hyundai Navigation Speed Limit`. O.S.M. will use both database and car head unit input to decide speed limit.

***SPAS***
----------
   - **THERE IS NO PANDA SAFETY CODE ATM**
   - **YOUR LIABLE FOR EVERYTHING. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK**
   - Install `SPAS` for EMS366 vehicles (most Genesis, Kia Stinger, Kona).
   - Install `SPAS_EEMS11` for EV's / Hybrids.
   - Install `SPAS_EMS11` for everything else
   - SPAS currently supports EMS366 and EMS11! EMS11 NEEDS testing(!!BE CAREFUL!!), EMS366 has been stable in all of my testing but in no way does that mean trust it. At its current stage, **DO NOT TRUST IT AND ALWAYS BE READY TO TAKE OVER WHEN USING SPAS!!!**
   - Sends parking assist messages up to 38mph, With safety code to do the following and more, Rate limit, Override disengage, OpenPilot Correctly! handles all 8 states of MDPS_stat. OpenPilot can understand all MDPS faults and react accordingly.
   - OpenPilot disables on override.
   - Overried driver torque thresehold is 2.2 nm and is set in "carcontroller.py".
   - OpenPilot winds up and unwinds on spas enable so no jerk.
   - Openpilot takes into account and handels all 8 states in the correct order.
   - Openpilot correctly handles all MDPS faults.
   - Openpilot handels switch from SPAS to LKAS and back correctly, not to spam if hovering around 41mph.
   - SPAS has a Delta V rate limit on the steering thats speed corralated located in "carcontroller.py".
   - Max SPAS steering angle is set in "carcontroller.py" .
   - SPAS to LKAS switch speed is 41mph and SHOULD NOT BE SET HIGHER! This causes a wobble. SPAS to LKAS switch speed can be lowerd in "carcontroller.py".
   - MDPS Harness needed. Reach out to johnpr#5623 on discord to buy a radar harness.

***HKG Long control toggle. (radar + vision)***
-----------------------------------------------
   - When toggled on, replaces the default Hyundai / Kia / Genesis factory longitudinal control system (SCC) with the openpilot system. May be useful for systems that don’t currently HAVE SCC but can support SCC via openpilot when programmed to another car variant(same model) that has radar..
   - Lead markers are not available unless you have HKG long.
   - Radar harness or mod is needed. 


***RetroPilot***
----------------

This fork uses RetroPilot for logging and online services.  https://api.retropilot.org/useradmin

Make sure "Upload Raw Logs" and "Enable Logger / Uploader" are both ON for this to work. 

**Hardware**
------------
The **Comma 3** should have significant performance improvements over Comma 2. **Comma 3 is untested** on this fork. I currently do not own a Comma 3 or have one on order. Help me reach my goal of rasing enough money for a Comma 3 to support users who upgraded.

title="PayPal – The safer, easier way to pay online!" border="0" />
</a>

The **Comma 2** has **POOR** performance with logging and uploader enabled so it's disabled by default. You can change that in `Settings` under `Community`.

- **MDPS Harnesses** are availaible for sale if you have the newer style plug. Contact johnpr#5623 on discord for more information.

- **Radar Harnesses** for Kia Stinger & G70 are for sale. Contact johnpr#5623 on discord for more information.

**Notes**
---------

Make sure to **shut off** auto start stop or you will get steering temporarily unavailable if the engine shuts off.

**Screen Recordings** 
- Saved to. `/storage/emulated/0/videos`

**Features**
------------

**Click** any of the settings to get a breif description in OpenPilot settings.

**Loading Logo**

The loading logo is automatically set to your HKG cars brand after the first boot, first car start, first reboot, and resets on update.

***nTune***
- nTune Auto Tunes lateral steering.

Run **nTune** after 30 - 50 miles of driving. It will autotune lateral control. Use this command `cd selfdrive && python ntune.py` or use the button in `Settings` under `Device`. (make sure your not driving!)

**Delete UI Screen Recordings button in `Settings` under `Device`.**

**Toggles**

- Toggles are in `Settings` under `Community`.

***Cluster Speed***

   - Uses the speed of the gauge cluster instead GPS speed.

***LDWS toggle***

   - under `Community` in `Settings`. For cars with LDWS but not SCC.

***Show Debug UI***

   - I feel like you should understand what “debugging” and a “UI” are before you can use openpilot

***Use SMDPS Harness***

   - Use of MDPS Harness to enable openpilot steering down to 0 MPH

***Built in TPMS Alerts***

   - An alert is displayed showing what tire and pressure is low.

***Stop Screen Capture on disengage toggle.***

***On screen blinkers and blind spot alerts.***

***Enable Lane Change Assist***

  - allows openpilot to change lanes. Driver is responsible for ensuring that it is SAFE to change lanes. Requires signal, and steering wheel nudge.

***Auto Lane Change with Blind spot monitoring toggle (No Nudge).***
  - Same as the original, now with 100% less nudge.

***Sync Speed on Gas Press***

  - openpilot will sync cruise control set speed to match last attained speed automatically

***Make sure to reboot with toggle changes.***

Then give it a spin.

***Behavior Notes***
--------------------

OpenPilot HKG Long will not see totally stopped cars yet until E2E comes in 0.9 so do not trust it to see and stop for a COMPLETLY stopped car.

If Collision Warning is beeping at you OpenPilot has calculated it can't stop quick enough due to safety limitations on unintentional braking. Please apply brakes to avoid collision.

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

Integration with Stock Features
------

In all supported cars:
* Stock Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and stock ALC are replaced by openpilot ALC, which only functions when openpilot is engaged by the user.
* Stock LDW is replaced by openpilot LDW.

Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in [supported cars](#supported-cars)):
* Stock ACC is replaced by openpilot ACC.
* openpilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.

openpilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but are not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.

Supported Hardware
------

At the moment, openpilot supports the [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-two-devkit). A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) is recommended to connect the EON or comma two to the car. For experimental purposes, openpilot can also run on an Ubuntu computer with external [webcams](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/webcam).

Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our [safety model](SAFETY.md). Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in `Settings->Developer->Enable Community Features`.

Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our [safety model](SAFETY.md). Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in `Settings->Developer->Enable Community Features`.

To promote a car from community maintained, it must meet a few requirements. We must own one from the brand, we must sell the harness for it, has full ISO26262 in both panda and openpilot, there must be a path forward for longitudinal control, it must have AEB still enabled, and it must support fingerprinting 2.0

Although they're not upstream, the community has openpilot running on other makes and models. See the 'Community Supported Models' section of each make [on our wiki](https://wiki.comma.ai/).

Installation Instructions
------

Install openpilot on an EON or comma two by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during the installer setup.

Follow these [video instructions](https://youtu.be/lcjqxCymins) to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: openpilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and openpilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.

Before placing the device on your windshield, check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some state laws prohibit or restrict the placement of objects on the windshield of a motor vehicle.

You will be able to engage openpilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.

Limitations of openpilot ALC and LDW
------

openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.

While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.
* In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.
* When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot ACC and FCW
------

openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.
* When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...
* In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by openpilot at this time.
* When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
* In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.
* When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.
* When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot DM
------

openpilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Low light conditions, such as driving at night or in dark tunnels.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* The driver's face is partially or completely outside field of view of the driver facing camera.
* The driver facing camera is obstructed, covered, or damaged.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. A driver should not rely on openpilot DM to assess their level of attention.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the comma connect app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect&hl=en_US)). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://my.comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/test.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The safety model code lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 EONs continuously replaying routes.

Testing on PC
------
For simplified development and experimentation, openpilot can be run in the CARLA driving simulator, which allows you to develop openpilot without a car. The whole setup should only take a few minutes.

Steps:
1) Start the CARLA server on first terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_carla.sh)"
```
2) Start openpilot on second terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_openpilot_docker.sh)"
```
3) Press 1 to engage openpilot

See the full [README](tools/sim/README.md)

You should also take a look at the tools directory in master: lots of tools you can use to replay driving data, test, and develop openpilot from your PC.


Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged.

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot-7ce0785eda84) and [Model](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.
